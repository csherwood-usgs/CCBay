This resides in ../proj/2015_Sandwich/CCBay_Modeling/CCBay on my desktop.

`CCBA_grid_v1` - Construct first version of coarse, medium, and fine grids using UAS map from 2016-03-30.

`CCBA_grid_v2` - Construct second version of coarse, medium, and fine grids using UAS map from 2017-01-25, producing grids called CG2, MG2, and FG2. These are the grids used for the SWAN runs described in the manuscript submitted to JMSE.

`CCBA_grid_v3` - Construct second version of coarse, medium, and fine grids using UAS map from 2017-04-28 and Traykovski jetyak bathymetry, producing grids called CG3, MG3, and FG3. These are the grids used for the SWAN runs while working on revisions to JMSE manuscript.
